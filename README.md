# Titanic Survival Analysis

## 📌 Problem Statement
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most well-known maritime disasters.
This project aims to analyze passenger data and build machine learning models to predict survival based on demographic and travel-related features.

The goal is to understand which factors influenced survival and how machine learning can be used for binary classification problems.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation port
- Each passenger is labeled as survived or not survived
- The dataset is commonly used for learning data analysis and classification techniques

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Handling missing values in age and embarkation columns
- Encoding categorical variables
- Removing irrelevant features
- Checking class imbalance

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to identify patterns and relationships in the data:
- Survival distribution across gender and passenger class
- Impact of age and fare on survival
- Visualization of key trends using plots

Insights from EDA were used to guide feature selection and model building.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
Steps followed in model building:
- Train-test split
- Feature engineering
- Training classification models
- Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

Basic supervised learning models were used to predict passenger survival.

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Gender and passenger class were strong indicators of survival
- Passengers in higher classes had better survival rates
- The model achieved reasonable performance for a baseline classification task

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
